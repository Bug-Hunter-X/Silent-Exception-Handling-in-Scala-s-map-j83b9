This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Scala related to exception handling within the `map` function. The code attempts to divide by zero, causing an exception. However, due to the `Try` block, this exception is silently handled and doesn't interrupt the `map`'s execution. The result is a list where the exception-causing element's value is simply skipped, which might lead to unexpected results and difficulty in debugging. The solution provides an improved approach that leverages for comprehensions for cleaner and safer exception handling.
